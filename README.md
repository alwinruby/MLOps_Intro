# MLOps Introduction


1. What is MLOps?

An abbreviation for Machine Learning Operations, describes the set of practices to design, deploy and maintain machine learning in production continuously, reliably, and efficiently.

'In production' means that we focus on machine learning that is used in business processes rather than a machine learning model that only exists on your laptop.


Since machine learning development and deployment is a complex process, MLOps originated to organize the processes involved. This can greatly help in getting machine learning into production.

What is not true about MLOps?

    MLOps focuses on software development in production.
    Although software might need to be written to develop and deploy machine learning, this is not the sole focus of MLOps.
